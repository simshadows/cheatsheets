        \item A major resource I used to learn about graphs and write this section out. Highly recommended to go through it yourself if you're still learning.
        \item I like the first sentence of the definition on page $626$, so I copied it verbatim for the first sentence of \cref{sec:graphs--basic-definitions}.
