\section{More Definitions}%
\label{sec:graphs--more-definitions}

\Todo{This is actually a temporary section and will probably not be in the final version. I'm just using it to write down some interesting definitions that might be useful later.}

\Todo{Consider adding \emph{Euler circuit}: A circuit that contains every vertex and edge of a graph. (That is, every edge is used exactly once, but vertices can be used multiple times.)}

\Todo{Consider adding \emph{Euler trail}: A trail that passes through every edge of a graph once, and every vertex at least once.}
