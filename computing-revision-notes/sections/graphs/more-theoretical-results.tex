\section{More Theoretical Results}%
\label{sec:graphs--more-theoretical-results}

\Todo{What theoretical results are useful to include here? Should we create a separate section for stuff towards the end of the chapter that aren't quite as useful for typical algorithms problems?}

\Todo{Include \emph{degree sum formula}: The sum of all degrees of a graph is twice the number of its edges. Corollary: the total degree of the graph is also be even. (Epp, Page 636)}

\Todo{Include \emph{handshake lemma} (lemma of degree sum formula): There is an even number of vertices of odd degree.}

\Todo{Consider including connectedness lemmas. (Epp, Page 647)}

\Todo{K\"{o}nigsberg bridge problem: If a graph has an Euler circuit, every vertex has positive even degree. If a connected graph has positive even degree, it has an Euler circuit. If a graph has odd degree, then it has no Euler circuit. A connected graph has an Euler circuit iff every vertex has positive degree. (Epp, Page 652)}

\Todo{The corollary on Epp Page 653: There is an Euler path iff the graph is connected, the start and end vertices have odd degree, and all other vertices have even degrees.}
