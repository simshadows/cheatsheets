\subsection{Introduction}

\Todo{Write this?}

\Todo{Make sure you cover:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item bit shifting
    \item IEEE 754 floating point, including special values, and cover quantization error and other important implications
    \item overcoming overflow/underflow
    \item ASCII, Unicode, and possibly other character encodings
    \item Modular arithmetic (especially useful for competitive programming)
\end{itemize}
